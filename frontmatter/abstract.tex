This project report gives an introduction to what Automatic Differentiation (AD) is and how it can be used to elegantly solve partial differential equations using a finite volume method and a discretization of the gradient- and divergence operator. 

An AD library has been implemented in the programming language Julia and compared to other AD libraries in Julia and MATLAB. For evaluating the function value and Jacobian of a vector function with three input vectors $x$, $y$ and $z$ the implemented AD library performs well. For vectors with length less than 2000 it perform better than all other AD libraries tested. Tests also indicates that the overhead accompanying for-loops is very little in Julia and this opens up possibilities for more efficient implementations than what have been done in this project.

The AD library has been used to create a flow solver modelling the flow of oil in a reservoir. Benchmarks shows that the
